== About me
I am a postdoctoral research associate with [https://www.varshney.csl.illinois.edu/ Lav Varshey] at [https://csl.illinois.edu/ CSL], [https://illinois.edu/ UIUC]. I'm currently working on multi-objective alignment and prompt optimization in LLMs.\n
\n
I got my PhD in [https://ece.illinois.edu/ ECE Department] at [https://illinois.edu/ UIUC], advised by [https://vvv.ece.illinois.edu/ Venu Veeravalli]. 
Before coming to UIUC, I graduated with a Dual Degree (B.Tech & M.Tech) in [https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ Electrical Engineering] from [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras], advised by [https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~skrishna/ Srikrishna Bhashyam].
Under my undergraduate studies, I had the pleasure of working with [https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~vaze/ Rahul Vaze] at [https://www.tifr.res.in/ TIFR].

== Research Interests
My research interests span the areas of LLMs, deep learning, reinforcement learning, statistical inference and information theory. I am driven by a quest to uncover the fundamental boundaries of learning problems through theoretical analysis while pioneering novel algorithms which achieve these limits with provable guarantees. I am deeply committed to developing principled solutions that address complex challenges across various domains. My portfolio encompasses projects in LLMs, deep compression, multi-armed bandits, robust inference, network optimization and packet scheduling. While the objectives of these endeavors differ, they are unified by a common pursuit of achieving optimality, efficiency, and robustness.
